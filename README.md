# ExpressJSReactSQL
This is a project that is used as a baseline for a Node JS , React and SQL server testing. As opposed to using MERN nodejs type projects

This project is a SERN Stack project. It has a client (React) and NodeJS service included that connects to a SQL Database. This is a very important project because all of my other 
projects are essentially MERN stack and MEVN stack
