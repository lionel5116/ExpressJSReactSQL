# ExpressJSReactSQL
This is a project that is used as a baseline for a Node JS , React and SQL server testing. As opposed to using MERN nodejs type projects

This project is a SERN Stack project. It has a client (React) and NodeJS service included that connects to a SQL Database. This is a very important project because all of my other 
projects are essentially MERN stack and MEVN stack

This project also has examples of MongoDB and MYSQL database operations as well
It's a very well rounded project

This project also has "Shopping Cart funtionality added to it as of 10/24/2023". It was a project I got off of Youtube (Brad Traversy)
